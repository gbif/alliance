# Background

In recent decades, numerous agencies, institutions and foundations around the world have supported the organization and delivery of digital information on biodiversity at global, national and other scales in support of scientific research, policy decisions and public engagement. 

However, such initiatives are generally guided by local priorities and focus on short-term deliverables using project funding. This scenario leads to duplication of effort and overlapping mandates which have delayed progress toward a sustainable, coordinated and interconnected global infrastructure for biodiversity information. 

The global biodiversity informatics community has explored these issues on multiple occasions. 

+ In 2009, the [e-Biosphere 09 conference](http://wayback.archive-it.org/org-660/20140924184516/http://www.e-biosphere09.org) brought together stakeholders from around the world to review progress and consider needs, but made no progress in aligning activities. 
+ In 2012, the Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC) developed a report, the [Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook: Delivering biodiversity knowledge in the Information Age](https://www.gbif.org/document/80859), or GBIO, which outlined an interconnected view of priority areas where the biodiversity informatics community needed to make progress.
+ In 2013, the [Biodiversity Informatics Horizons](https://sciencenode.org/announcement/biodiversity-informatics-horizons-2013-conference.php) led to a set of recommendations published as [A decadal view of biodiversity informatics: challenges and priorities](https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6785-13-16), which offered a series of recommendations for advancing the field. 
+ Between 2011 and 2014, the European Commission funded the [CReATIVE-B project](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100345_en.html)—Coordination of Research e-Infrastructures Activities Toward an International Virtual Environment for Biodiversity—to enable a number of major initiatives to explore synergies and alignments between their activities. 

Most recently, in March 2017, the [Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung](http://www.senckenberg.de) hosted a workshop on Exploring Synergies and Sustainability for Biodiversity Information Systems. Attendees representing global data infrastructures, national data centres and major research institutions agreed on the need to establish a shared mechanism for planning and delivering a linked and open global biodiversity data infrastructure. 

Cooperation is required now to establish how such a mechanism can work and can support the widest possible set of international partners, but a central component is expected to be a small project office working with all relevant parties to set, agree and enact shared priorities. Such priorities would include short-term needs to develop tools, standards and best practices, medium-term needs to integrate and streamline infrastructures and investments and long-term, multi-decadal needs to ensure sustainability of services and knowledge products. The overall vision is to enable international parties to work together efficiently and for a global network of institutions and organizations to be able to take responsibility for components that fit together to create a fully interconnected whole.

Attendees at the March workshop proposed that GBIF could undertake a steering role around development of priorities and around coordinating efforts to secure sustainable funding and delivery of these priorities. The GBIF Governing Board responded to this request by supporting plans for GBIC2 in Copenhagen on 24-27 July 2018.
