# Shared ambitions
We believe that delivering robust interconnected communities, systems and processes to handle biodiversity information for the common good can best be achieved through a lightweight alliance between all stakeholders with an interest in this outcome.

Accordingly, as signatories, we acknowledge out intent to collaborate in developing such an alliance focused on achieving the following interlinked ambitions:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Support for science and evidence-based planning_

1.	To deliver biodiversity knowledge and understanding in forms which support critical research requirements and enable biodiversity to be correctly measured and valued for societal goals
2.	To serve as the foundation for basic research in biodiversity and information science that serves human understanding of the functioning and state of natural systems 
3.	To provide a platform for continuous growth in understanding of biodiversity by preserving, building on and improving existing knowledge

    _Support for open data and open science_

4.	To remove barriers to free and open sharing of data and to the adoption of FAIR data principles  for biodiversity data
5.	To describe all data resources with rich metadata that supports present and future reuse
6.	To ensure all data resources are preserved in stable and persistent trusted repositories
7.	To enable collaborative curation, annotation and improvement of all data by any relevant experts and expert communities
8.	To enable all contributors of knowledge or expertise to have their contributions fully recorded, acknowledged and credited
9.	To track the provenance and attribution of all sources of information

    _Support for highly-connected biodiversity data_

10.	To mobilize structured digital representations of historical data sources, including museum collections and literature
11.	To ensure that all new observations and measurements are accessible in structured digital representations as rapidly as possible after capture
12.	To enable the combination, querying and analysis of different classes of biodiversity information (distribution, traits, genes, etc.) as an interconnected whole
13.	To work with other research communities and infrastructures to achieve interoperability with earth observations, social science data and other resources

    _Support for international collaboration_

14.	To address capacity needs around biodiversity informatics in all regions and in all sectors
15.	To secure funding to maintain services and component that the community recognizes as critical elements within a distributed knowledge infrastructure
16.	To develop flexible, collaborative approaches to designing, building and sustaining all components of this distributed knowledge infrastructure
17.	To enable stakeholders in every country and region to adopt and benefit from advances in infrastructure, tools, services, practices and capacity
18.	To enable full participation of and collaboration with all stakeholder groups in all regions at all stages, from data generation to analysis and application
19.	To enable data repatriation that supports science and policy-making in all countries and regions
20.	To ensure effective access to, and use of, data at every scaleâ€”global, regional, national and local
21.	To acknowledge and support the role of regional, national and local investments as critical and effective components within a global solution
22.	To overcome barriers to data sharing or use arising from language or culture
