# Scope and Goals for GBIC2


+ Develop the attendeesâ€™ consensus vision for how a global-scale coordination mechanism for biodiversity informatics planning should work, including its scope, governance and required resources
+ Prepare and publish a white paper communicating this vision to scientific and policy audiences
+ Agree on next steps for soliciting input from non-attendees and for preparing to seek funding required to establish the mechanism
+ Explore in a workshop situation how to structure and document decadal roadmaps for international collaborative implementation of biodiversity informatics components
+ Offer draft exemplar roadmaps from these workshops to provide a concrete perspective on expected outputs
