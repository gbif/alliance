GBIC2: the 2nd Global Biodiversity Information Conference
===================

_Delivering biodiversity knowledge in the information age_

The first GBIC conference took place in Copenhagen, Denmark in July 2012 and led to the publication of the _Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook_ (GBIO), a vision for the major component areas around which biodiversity informatics needed to be progressed. The GBIO vision remains as relevant today, as the scientific community continues to wrestle with the magnitude of the task of describing the diversity of life and documenting the complexity of its functions and as society works to improve planning of natural resources at all scales and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Knowledge and understanding of biodiversity needs to be organised as a robust and accessible digital resource which can support all of these needs.

In the years since GBIC, the global community has made significant advances in some of these areas, but progress is uneven. There are many factors contributing to this, including culture and sociology as well as technology, but a key issue is the nature of funding for relevant activity. Researchers and practitioners advance biodiversity informatics largely through small- to medium-scale projects, initiated in response to local interests and priorities. This leads to a proliferation of standards, tools and processes which do not combine into a fully interoperable whole.

[Recent efforts](./background) have repeatedly identified the need for biodiversity informatics stakeholders to collaborate at a global scale to identify common priorities and coordinate implementation of these priorities. There is a clear need for an open and trusted mechanism that allows the international community to develop a shared vision for each of the component areas in the GBIO and to agree on the major elements and components which need to be prioritised to achieve these visions. Once such priorities are agreed, continued coordination could allow the community to support efforts by agencies and institutions in different countries to secure funding and to implement these components on behalf of all. 

GBIC2 will convene a broad group of stakeholders to discuss how an international coordination mechanism for biodiversity informatics could operate and how it could accelerate delivery of the linked and open global biodiversity data infrastructure needed by science and society. The workshop will consider issues around governance and trust, technical and sociological factors, and funding and sustainability for establishing such a mechanism. In order to keep the discussions practical, GBIC2 will include parallel sessions exploring challenges which will arise in developing priorities and a multi-year roadmap for each of [four GBIO component areas](./programme).

Attendance will be limited and unfortunately GBIC2 will be conducted entirely in English. However, the workshop is only considered to be the opening stage in a broader consultation process. Following GBIC2, the outcomes and recommendations from the discussions will be shared publicly and translated into multiple languages, after which all stakeholders with an interest in the future of biodiversity informatics will be encouraged to criticise and improve the proposals.
