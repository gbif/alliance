Delegates to the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference—GBIC2—called for a __global alliance for biodiversity knowledge__ to align efforts to deliver current, accurate and comprehensive data, information and knowledge on the world's biodiversity. 

This alliance is open to all institutions, agencies, organizations, researchers and communities working to measure and monitor biodiversity or dependent on accurate information on biodiversity. By joining forces, every stakeholder will benefit from free and open access to the best possible evidence to address questions at all scales.

Join us in the next phase—help us in aligning resources and investments in biodiversity informatics to improve knowledge of the world's species and understanding of the dynamics of natural systems in support of a sustainable future for science and society.
