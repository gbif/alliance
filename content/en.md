an alliance for biodiversity knowledge
===================

In July 2018, GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) with the aim of better aligning efforts to make current, accurate data and information on the world's biodiversity freely and openly available at all scales. More than 100 delegates converged on an ambitious, multifaceted vision for an alliance for biodiversity knowledge. 

The alliance intends to develop shared, sustainable roadmaps that help focus resources and investment across all scales, delivering an integrated, interlinked knowledge base that addresses common needs across biodiversity informatics domains. The result will embed current scientific understanding of biodiversity within rational and timely decision-making processes to support a sustainable future for science and society.
