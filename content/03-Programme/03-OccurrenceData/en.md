# Integrated Occurrence Data

_Making accessible all data about when and where any given named organism has been recorded_

The Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook provided the following summary:

> Documenting the distribution of species in time and space may be viewed as the ‘weather observations’ of biodiversity: the
fundamental underpinning for any accurate model of existing patterns and trends. All of the data sources outlined in focus area
B (Data) will contribute species occurrence records in some form or another, but the key elements of every record need to be brought
together in a more readily accessible and usable form to enable efficient discovery and use.

> Many national, regional and thematic efforts such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and VertNet are
already mobilizing significant quantities of data on specimens and biodiversity observations. Mature data standards such as
Darwin Core and the Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD) schema have enabled GBIF to index and organize data from
thousands of such sources. The GBIF data portal already offers access to more than 400 million species occurrence records.

> In the short term, national, regional and thematic networks that already handle occurrence data should work to link their data to
global networks. Global activities such as GBIF should enhance their processes to improve understanding and fitness-for-use of all
mobilized data, to provide support for data on species abundance and sampling events, and to ensure that all contributors receive
appropriate acknowledgement and feedback for their work. In the medium term, additional sources of data on species occurrence,
including published materials (B1), sequences and genomes (B4) and automated and remote-sensed observations (B5),
should also be integrated. In the long term, globally-connected networks should continuously and automatically process all new
observations and samples of biodiversity.

In recent years,  

More specifically, 

Many challenges remain. 

GBIC2 will include a working session to explore the challenges which may impede progress in these areas.  The goal will not be to develop a multi-year roadmap and set of fully-refined priorities for Integrated Occurrence Data as a component of the biodiversity informatics landscape, although recommendations from the session will be taken forward for this purpose.  The key goal in the context of GBIC2 is to understand the nature of the impediments which limit progress in this area towards seamless unified access and use of occurrence data and continuous stable management of these data as a global resource. Thus will enable the GBIC2 workshop to consider the best approach to address these impediments within the governance and the planning processes of an international coordination mechanism.
