_Workshop components_

GBIC2 will include in-depth explorations of one key component from each of
the four layers identified in the GBIO framework. Focusing on the following components will
ensure consideration of both technical and societal aspects and address well-understood
elements and other elements for which solutions are at best preliminary:

+ [Biodiversity knowledge network](./knowledgenetwork/) (Culture): developing models, social networks,
reputation and recognition systems to empower and reward professionals and
knowledgeable amateurs to contribute to the curation and improvement of digital
biodiversity information. This component area involves mostly sociological aspects of
integration and change, bringing together skills from a different set of contributors.
+ [Published materials](./publishedmaterials/) (Data): addressing the challenges of offering digital access to
centuries of information gathered and stored in non-digital formats, including
transformation of this information into structured data for synthesis with existing
digital resources. This component area involves a diverse stakeholders with
opportunities to increase alignment and reuse of informatics tools, including optical
character recognition, gazetteers and vocabularies, and automated translation
services.
+ [Integrated occurrence data](./occurrencedata/) (Evidence): aligning activities around the world to
aggregate spatial evidence of species occurrence, removing duplication of effort, and
ensuring delivery of the most comprehensive integrated data resource possible. This
component area offers immediate opportunities for alignment since several key
infrastructures are already starting discussions on how to achieve this.
+ [Trends and predictions](trends) (Understanding): delivering time-sensitive analyses of
available evidence and developing robust models for past and future scenarios. This
component area presents different challenges around credibility, governance and
integration of multiple sources of biotic and abiotic information.
