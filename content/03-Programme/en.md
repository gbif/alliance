# Programme

GBIC2 will include four components:
1. Plenary presentations to establish a common baseline understanding of the [GBIO](../gbio) and the goals for GBIC2, and to consider the broader context of planning and funding for research infrastructures
2. Workshop to explore and refine a possible model for an international coordination mechanism for future planning and collaborative funding of biodiversity informatics infrastructure
3. [Parallel workshops](#areas) to evaluate the feasibility of using such a mechanism in the context of some of the major component areas identified in the GBIO
4. Review session to refine a proposed model in the light of issues identified in the parallel workshops

Following GBIC2, the plan is to expand the consultation with a report on findings from the workshop and a draft model for an international coordination mechanism.  This report and the associated consultation will be translated into multiple languages to enable the widest possible participation and to ensure that any follow-on implementation is not unnecessarily limited to speakers of any particular language or from any particular region.

Subsequently, the goal is to seek funding to establish and support joint planning practices based on the recommended model.

### <a name="areas"></a>GBIO component areas for parallel workshops

GBIC2 will include in-depth explorations of one key component from each of
the four layers identified in the GBIO framework. Focusing on the following components will
ensure consideration of both technical and societal aspects and address well-understood
elements and other elements for which solutions are at best preliminary:

+ [Biodiversity knowledge network](./knowledgenetwork/) (Culture): developing models, social networks,
reputation and recognition systems to empower and reward professionals and
knowledgeable amateurs to contribute to the curation and improvement of digital
biodiversity information. This component area involves mostly sociological aspects of
integration and change, bringing together skills from a different set of contributors.
+ [Published materials](./publishedmaterials/) (Data): addressing the challenges of offering digital access to
centuries of information gathered and stored in non-digital formats, including
transformation of this information into structured data for synthesis with existing
digital resources. This component area involves a diverse stakeholders with
opportunities to increase alignment and reuse of informatics tools, including optical
character recognition, gazetteers and vocabularies, and automated translation
services.
+ [Integrated occurrence data](./occurrencedata/) (Evidence): aligning activities around the world to
aggregate spatial evidence of species occurrence, removing duplication of effort, and
ensuring delivery of the most comprehensive integrated data resource possible. This
component area offers immediate opportunities for alignment since several key
infrastructures are already starting discussions on how to achieve this.
+ [Trends and predictions](trends) (Understanding): delivering time-sensitive analyses of
available evidence and developing robust models for past and future scenarios. This
component area presents different challenges around credibility, governance and
integration of multiple sources of biotic and abiotic information.
