# Trends and Predictions

_Using predictive modelling to assess status, trends and the impacts of any potential changes_

The Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook provided the following summary:

> Being able to model future trends in biodiversity under different conditions (such as the outcomes of particular policies or
climate change) are key to sound decision making. The wealth of historical data that focus area B (Data) will unlock from the literature
and museum collections, and the existing long-term ecological monitoring sites, provide a temporal dimension to the available evidence for our spatial models. Mobilizing all of these data will enable not only multiscale spatial modelling (D1) of current
biodiversity patterns, but also to construct a series of historical models, at least for some taxonomic groups and for some regions
and scales of detail. These models will in turn help us to identify trends, to explore the key drivers behind these trends and to
predict responses to potential future changes. Having good predictive tools are a key element for the better management of
biodiversity, so developing this component should be a matter of high priority.

> A number of projects, such as the Wallace Initiative, ClimaScope, eHabitat and the Ermitage project, already use biodiversity data
to explore the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity, while the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA) is
looking at building interoperable modelling services for biodiversity. The next step will be to create a group equivalent to the Task
Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impacts and Climate Analysis (TGICA) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) to establish the baseline data and methodologies, workflows and repositories needed.

> In the short term, mechanisms are required to assess the suitability of integrated occurrence data for different species to support
development of a series of historical distribution models, and to establish guidelines for the work in focus area A (Culture) and focus area B (Data) to maximize the suitability of the data for temporal modelling. In the medium term, work should focus on visualization of such models and on algorithms to explore the drivers behind apparent changes in biodiversity. In the long term, these insights should
support development of tools to model predicted changes in biodiversity in response to human-induced pressures such as
climate change, land use change and the expected impacts of invasive species on ecosystems.

In recent years,  

More specifically, 

Many challenges remain. 

GBIC2 will include a working session to explore the challenges which may impede progress in these areas.  The goal will not be to develop a multi-year roadmap and set of fully-refined priorities for supporting work on Trends and Predictions as an output from the biodiversity informatics landscape, although recommendations from the session will be taken forward for this purpose.  The key goal in the context of GBIC2 is to understand the nature of the impediments which limit progress in this area towards the best possible international systems for monitoring trends and making predictions. Thus will enable the GBIC2 workshop to consider the best approach to address these impediments within the governance and the planning processes of an international coordination mechanism.
