una alianza para el conocimiento de la biodiversidad
===================

_Delivering biodiversity knowledge in the information age_

> [__Read our shared ambitions__](../es/call-to-action/) and [__sign on__](../es/sign/)

Biodiversity is responsible for maintaining the systems of life, providing us with food and regulating the environment, yet it is under great pressure as humans continue to transform all parts of the planet.

A sustainable future depends on deeper understanding of the complexity of life on earth. Researchers, including amateur observers, have been recording information about the diversity of species that share this world for centuries— documenting their biology and interactions and monitoring changes to their patterns of distribution and organization.
 
Modern advances in digital communications, high-resolution imaging, rapid sequencing and other technologies are now accelerating the speed and richness of data captured. Many infrastructures and projects have been established at all scales—global, regional, national, local and institutional—seeking to handle, organize and curate this information. These efforts remain insufficiently aligned and interconnected, however, to deliver the comprehensive perspectives required by science, governments and society.
 
A diverse group of more than 100 international experts attended the [GBIC2 conference](../es/gbic2/2018-conference/) in Copenhagen in July 2018 and issued [a call for much closer collaboration](../es/shared-ambitions/) between research communities, technology providers, research infrastructures, governments, NGOs, societies and local communities—all aimed at delivering a truly global approach to organize biodiversity data for the benefit of all.

Working together, we propose the establishment of a lightweight alliance to foster closer coordination and planning and to form open participatory projects, increasing connectivity and fostering frictionless and comprehensive access to available data. This site provides willing partners with an opportunity to [express their interest in this alliance](../es/sign/) and to participate in the next steps toward making it a reality.
