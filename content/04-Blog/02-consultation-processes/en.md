# Plans for consultation processes within the _alliance for biodiversity knowledge_
_[Donald Hobern](mailto:dhobern@gbif.org), GBIF Secretariat, 9 March 2019_

The goal of the _alliance for biodiversity knowledge_ is to be as inclusive as possible and open to inputs from all interested stakeholders. We propose therefore to consult as widely as possible at all stages in the planning and establishment of the _alliance_ and also as a model for how the _alliance_ should carry on all its future business.

The focus during 2019 will be on establishing the model, governance and operational plans for the _alliance_. Several forms of consultation will be used to make this happen.

### Web forum

We have opened several discussion threads on the [GBIF Discourse Forum](../../discussion/) to capture early responses and comments on the concept of the _alliance_. We hope that discussion on these threads will help to define the parameters for subsequent consultations. Please contribute to the discussion by entering any concerns or questions and helping us to understand what issues need further exploration. At this stage, these forum threads are in English, but we welcome posts in other languages and will seek to integrate ideas into the English-languafe discussions.

We will use this [blog](../) to provide perspectives that may contribute to the discussions. If you are interested in authoring a blog post (in English or another language), please email us at [alliance@gbif.org](mailto:alliance@gbif.org).

### White papers

We plan to summarize intermediate proposals and final decisions as a series of white papers. We will seek involvement of interested stakeholders as contributing authors during preparation of these papers. Each paper will then be presented for broader discussion and refinement, with versions or summaries offered in multiple languages whenever feasible. We will use _virtual conferences_ or _face-to-face workshops_ (both discussed below) to support the conversation where significant or complex matters require evaluation. 

If we do not reach adequate consensus about next steps, the process will repeat with further consultation around a revised document.

Please follow the discussion and [register to participate](../../sign/) in all stages in this process. By joining the mailing list, you will be kept informed of consultations as they are announced. We also welcome offers of assistance in translating materials into languages other than English.

### Virtual conferences

Some consultations will require intensive discussion by many stakeholders. As far as possible, we hope to make such consultations as open and inclusive as possible. 




I was reading this piece in the Washington Post:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/12/10/we-study-climate-we-chose-not-fly-dc-conference-it/

It led me to search a little around current options for virtual conference solutions that might be appropriate for international communities. I am surprised there is so little evidence that people are working on standard solutions. However, I did find this:

The model they propose in this paper is hardly complex, although some effort would be needed to set it up well. It’s actually close to some ideas we have discussed on various occasions. Even if we only started with this for a small subset of the many meetings GBIF itself organizes, I’d like to suggest that we consider trying this approach. Some specific comments:

* Obviously saving carbon is the big issue but the suggested model allows anyone to participate in collaborative discussion without having to travel or work outside their normal or preferred working hours
* The fact that all materials, including discussion threads, can be saved and made available online for subsequent access is a major positive
* It would be possible to use this model in a closed, authenticated version for meetings with a restricted audience
* Above all, a model like this would be fantastic for any alliance workshops or discussions – it can facilitate open involvement by participants everywhere, including those without access to travel funds
* Facilitation is key, and clearly different in some ways from a face-to-face event, but with good planning and design of the tools, should be readily manageable
* The savings in travel costs could fund development of a good tool/platform for this purpose.

Here is the central summary from inside the document:

In a nutshell, here is how this NCN approach works (note that it differs significantly from a typical webinar using Skype or similar technologies):

1. Speakers record their own talks. This can be A) a video of them speaking, generally filmed with a webcam or smartphone, B) a screen recording of a presentation, such as a PowerPoint, or C) a hybrid of the two, with speaker and presentation alternately or simultaneously onscreen. Here are examples of speaker, presentation, and hybrid presentations from the May 2016 UCSB conference. Alternate approaches are also possible, such as this talk from the conference, which is a short documentary with the talk as a voiceover. Note that even smartphones can now produce videos of broadcast resolution.
2. Talks are viewed on the conference website. Once made available on the conference website, talks can be viewed at any time. Talks are organized into panels (i.e. individual webpages) that generally have three speakers each and a shared Q&A session – just like a traditional conference. As they are prerecorded, videos can be closed captioned for greater accessibility, as were all the talks for UCSB’s second NCN conference. Visit a sample panel.
3. Participants contribute to an online Q&A session. During the time that the conference is open, which is generally two or three weeks, participants can take part in the Q&A sessions for the panels, which are similar to online forums, by posing and responding to written questions and comments. Because comments can be made at any time in any time zone, participants from across the globe can equally take part in the conference. Jump to a sample Q&A.

### Face-to-face workshops
