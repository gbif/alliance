# Plans for consultation processes within the _alliance for biodiversity knowledge_
_Donald Hobern, GBIF Secretariat, [dhobern@gbif.org](mailto:dhobern@gbif.org)_, 9 March 2019

The goal of the _alliance for biodiversity knowledge_ is to be as inclusive as possible and open to inputs from all interested stakeholders. We propose therefore to consult as widely as possible at all stages in the planning and establishment of the _alliance_ and also as a model for how the _alliance_ should carry on all its future business.

The focus during 2019 will be on establishing the model, governance and operational plans for the _alliance_. Several forms of consultation will be used to make this happen.

### Web forum

### Virtual conferences

### White papers

### Face-to-face workshops
